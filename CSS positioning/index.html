        People often misuse <code>position</code> when writing CSS, once they discover it can move things to wherever they want them to be on the screen, 
        but it can lead to a lot of problems, especially with responsiveness, but can also lead to hard to maintain code in general as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        This demo is put together to help explore all the different positioning values we have, how they work, and how you might actually want to use them 
        in real projects, as well as the problems that can come up when using positioning and how we can overcome (or avoid) them.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most important things with positioning is being aware of all the side-effects that come with using it, and also the different things 
        we can do to properly control it to have it do exactly what we want to.
