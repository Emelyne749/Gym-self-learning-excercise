// Imagine you are developing a real-time news application that needs to fetch posts from three different sources to provide users with the latest updates.
// The API endpoints for getting posts are:
// https://dummyjson.com/posts
// https://this-may-not-exist.com/posts
// https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
// To ensure a seamless user experience, you should create a function called getFastPosts that fetches posts from these endpoints simultaneously (concurrently) and only presents data from the source that responds the quickest, while ignoring slower or potentially unreliable sources.
// Example of how the function should be used
// // getFastPosts() code here...

// getFastPosts().then((posts) => {
//     console.log(posts)
// })



let links =["https://dummyjson.com/posts", "https://this-may-not-exist.com/posts", "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"]

async function getFastPosts(urls) {
    let response = urls.map(url => fetch(url))
    let results = await Promise.any(response)
    let result = await results.json()
    return result
}

getFastPosts(links).then(res=>console.log(res))
