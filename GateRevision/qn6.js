// Create a counter function that counts from 1 to 5, with a 1-second delay between each number. The function should return a promise that resolves with an array of all the numbers when counting is complete. This tests your ability to create async flows with timing and collect results over time.
// Requirements:
// Function asyncCounter() counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
// 1-second delay between each number
// Return promise that resolves with [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// Use async/await or promise chaining

function counter(nbr){
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(nbr)
            resolve(nbr)
        }, 1000)
    })
}


async function counterlimit() {
    let res = []
    for(n=1;n<=5;n++){
        let number = await counter(n)
        res.push(number)
    }
    return res
}

counterlimit().then(x => console.log(x))
